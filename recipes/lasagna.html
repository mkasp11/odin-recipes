    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>"[This is] actually quite easy to make for someone who has never made lasagna before," according to jimbob2229. 
        "I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and added spinach. Everyone loved it, and I will definitely make it again."</p>
    <p>"I didn't have any ground pork in the house, so I omitted that ingredient, but it was great with just the beef," says one 
        Allrecipes community member. "The sauce came out terrific too, much better than the stuff you find in jars."</p>
